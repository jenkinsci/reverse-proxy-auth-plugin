# Jenkins Reverse Proxy Authentication and Authorisation Plugin

The Reverse proxy plugin providers developers the ability to have easy and simple authentication and authorisation using SSO techniques. The plugin authenticates the user in Jenkins via a HTTP header field.

When it comes to authorisation, the offers two options to developers: HTTP header containing LDAP groups or LDAP discovery. When one of the mentioned options is used, the developer can have Jenkins configured to use role based matrix authorisation, that will read the groups that were configured in the Reverse Proxy plugin.

## The default values for the HTTP header fields are:

1. Header User Name: X-Forwarded-User
2. Header Groups Name: X-Forwarded-Groups
3. Header Groups Delimiter: |

The LDAP options can be displayed via the Advanced... button, located on the right side of the security settings.

If no LDAP information is given, the default used will be the HEADER fields. However, if both are configured, the LDAP has priority over the HTTP header.

If the username is not forwarded to Jenkins, the user will be authenticated as ANONYMOUS. When LDAP groups are sent via the HTTP header, there is no check if the username exists in the LDAP directory, so protect your proxy in order to avoid HTTP Header injection. Once an username is informed, the user will be authenticated. If no groups are returned from the LDAP search, the user will still be authenticated, but no other grants will be given.

However, once the LDAP is properly configured instead of groups on the HTTP header, there is guarantee that only the groups of a given user will be returned. There is no possibility to get groups injected via the header.

See the fields in [ReverseProxySecurityRealm.java](https://github.com/jenkinsci/reverse-proxy-auth-plugin/blob/master/src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/reverse_proxy_auth/ReverseProxySecurityRealm.java) for details about the available options.

## Alternative authentication: API Token
An other possibility to authenticate is to the use an HTTP Basic authentication with the Jenkins API Token.

If both methods (header specific for this plugin and HTTP Basic authentication) are used, the plugin header takes precedence.

# Documentation from wiki (please edit!)

This plugin lets you delegate the authentication to the reverse proxy
that you run in front of Jenkins. It also includes Authorisation, which
is done via LDAP groups loaded from the HTTP header or LDAP search -
based on the username.This plugin is useful in an environment where you
have a reverse proxy, such as Apache, already available and configured
to perform necessary user authentication. This reverse proxy must pass
the authenticated user name in an HTTP header of a fixed name. With this
plugin, Jenkins that run behind it will simply look at this header and
use its value as the user name. In the newest release, version 1.3, this
plugin also offers Authorisation mechanism. The user can have Role Based
Matrix Authorization configured, which will look up into LDAP groups
that can be loaded into Jenkins either via HTTP header groups field or
LDAP search.

The default values for the HTTP header fields are:

1.  Header User Name: X-Forwarded-User
2.  Header Groups Name: X-Forwarded-Groups
3.  Header Groups Delimiter: \|\#\# In case no LDAP server is informed
    the plugin will try to take the information from the HTTP header.
    When no header groups information can be retrieved, in case the user
    wants to do authentication only, and there is no LDAP server
    configured, the user retrieved from the header will have only
    Authenticated authority available.

## Apache Configuration Example

    <VirtualHost *:80>
      ProxyPreserveHost On
      ProxyRequests     Off
      AllowEncodedSlashes NoDecode
      Timeout 5400
      ProxyTimeout 5400

      <Proxy "*">
        Order deny,allow
        Allow from all
        Authtype BASIC
        AuthName "Please sign in with your Apache user name and password"
        # file created with htpasswd
        AuthUserFile /usr/local/apache2/conf/passwd
        Require valid-user

        # Remove these header before to set the right value after, it prevent the client from setting this header
        RequestHeader unset "X-Forwarded-User"
        RequestHeader unset "X-Forwarded-Groups"
        # Remove the basic authorization header to avoid to use it in Jenkins
        RequestHeader unset "Authorization"

        # Adds the X-Forwarded-User header that indicates the current user name.
        # this portion came from http://old.nabble.com/Forcing-a-proxied-host-to-generate-REMOTE_USER-td2911573.html#a2914465
        RewriteEngine On

        # User to use to login in Jenkins
        RequestHeader set "X-Forwarded-User" "%{RU}e"
        # Groups are separated by |
        RequestHeader set "X-Forwarded-Groups" "%{RU}e|users"

        # strip the REALM of Kerberos Login
        # RequestHeader edit X-Forwarded-User "@REALM$" ""

        # see the Apache documentation on why this has to be lookahead
        RewriteCond %{LA-U:REMOTE_USER} (.+)
        # this actually doesn't rewrite anything. what we do here is to set RU to the match above
        # "NS" prevents flooding the error log
        RewriteRule .* - [E=RU:%1,NS]
      </Proxy>

      # send you to the Jenkins instance
      ProxyPass "/jenkins" "http://jenkins.example.com:8282/jenkins" nocanon
      ProxyPassReverse "/jenkins" "http://jenkins.example.com:8282/jenkins"
    </virtualhost>

## Notes

-   Make sure that clients cannot bypass the reverse proxy. If they can
    send requests directly to Jenkins, then a malicious client can send
    in arbitrary header name with arbitrary value, thus compromising the
    security of Jenkins
-   Make sure you configure the reverse proxy to erase the header that
    you use to pass the authenticated user name. This prevents malicious
    client from setting the header name with arbitrary value, which
    would ruin the security.
-   If your authorisation need is simple (for example, every valid user
    gets full access and everyone else gets no access), then you need
    not use this plugin, as you can do both authentication and
    authorisation in the reverse proxy.
-   Hit <http://yourserver/whoAmI> to see the actual HTTP headers your
    Apache is sending to Jenkins. This is useful for trouble-shooting.

## Jenkins says my reverse proxy setup is broken...

Since Jenkins 1.572 this message can also appear if you don't access
Jenkins through a reverse proxy: Make sure the Jenkins URL configured in
the System Configuration matches the URL you're using to access Jenkins.

## Symptoms

An error message is displayed in the "Manage Jenkins" page - "It appears
that your reverse proxy set up is broken"

## Background

For a reverse proxy to work correctly, it needs to rewrite both the
request and the response. Request rewriting involves receiving an
inbound HTTP call and then making a forwarding request to Jenkins
(sometimes with some HTTP headers modified, sometimes not). Failing to
configure the request rewriting is easy to catch, because you just won't
see any pages at all.

But correct reverse proxying also involves one of two options, EITHER

-   rewriting the response (for more information see [Hyperlinks in
    HTML](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Hyperlinks+in+HTML)).
    The primary place where this needs to happen is the "Location"
    header in the response, which is used during redirects. Jenkins will
    send back "Location: <http://actual.server:8080/jenkins/foobar>" and
    the reverse proxy needs to rewrite this to "Location:
    <http://nice.name/jenkins/foobar>". Unfortunately, failing to
    configure this correctly is harder to catch; OR
-   Setting the `X-Forwarded-Host` (and perhaps `X-Forwarded-Port`)
    header on the forwarded request. Jenkins will parse those headers
    and generate all the redirects and other links on the basis of those
    headers. Depending on your reverse proxy it may be easier to
    set `X-Forwarded-Host` and `X-Forwarded-Port` to the hostname and
    port in the original `Host` header respectively or it may be easier
    to just pass the original `Host` header through
    as  `X-Forwarded-Host` and delete the `X-Forwarded-Port` header from
    the request. You will also need to set the `X-Forwarded-Proto`
    header if your reverse proxy is changing from `https` to `http` or
    vice-versa

So Jenkins has a proactive monitoring to make sure this is configured
correctly. It uses XmlHttpRequest to request a specific URL in Jenkins
(via relative path, so this will always get through provided the request
is properly rewritten), which will then redirect the user to another
page in Jenkins (this only works correctly if you configured the
response rewriting correctly), which then returns 200.

This error message indicates that this test is failing - and the most
likely cause is that the response rewriting is misconfigured. See
the **Server Configuration Guides** (below) for additional tips about
configuring a reverse proxy. 

Note. The reverse proxy tests were improved in release 1.552 so users
with previously working proxy setups may start to receive proxy
warnings. 

Be sure to set the `X-Forwarded-Proto` header if your reverse proxy is
accessed via HTTPS and then Jenkins itself is accessed via HTTP i.e.
proxying HTTPS to HTTP.

Changing the context path of Jenkins with a reverse proxy is fraught
with danger. There are lots of URLs that you need to rewrite correctly,
and even if you get the ones in HTML files you may miss some in
javascript, CSS or XML resources.

The recommendation is to ensure that Jenkins is running at the context
path that your reverse proxy is serving Jenkins at. You will have the
least pain if you keep to this principle.

While it is technically possible to use rewrite rules to change the
context path, you should be aware that it would be a lot of work to find
and fix everything in your rewrite rules and the reverse proxy will
spend most of its time rewriting responses from Jenkins. Much easier to
change Jenkins to run at the context path your reverse proxy is
expecting, e.g. if your reverse proxy is forwarding requests at
<https://manchu.example.org/foobar/> to Jenkins then you could just use
`java -jar jenkins.war --prefix /foobar` to start jenkins using
`/foobar` as the context path

 

## Further Diagnosis

For further diagnosis, try using cURL:

``` syntaxhighlighter-pre
curl -iL -e http://your.reverse.proxy/jenkins/manage \
   http://your.reverse.proxy/jenkins/administrativeMonitor/hudson.diagnosis.ReverseProxySetupMonitor/test
```

(assuming your Jenkins is located at
<http://your.reverse.proxy/jenkins/> - and is open to anonymous read
access)

## Server Configuration Guides

While the pages talk primarily about Apache / NGinX / HAProxy / Squid,
they also have information that applies to other reverse proxies.

    Apache](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/system-administration/reverse-proxy-configuration-apache)
-   [Running Jenkins behind
    Nginx](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/system-administration/reverse-proxy-configuration-nginx)

If using Apache check that *nocanon* is set on *ProxyPass* and
that *AllowEncodedSlashes* is set as per the Apache link above.

*AllowEncodedSlashes* is not inherited in Apache configs, so this
directive must be placed inside the *VirtualHost* definition.
