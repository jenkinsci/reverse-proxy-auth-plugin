    This setup assumes that you have a front-end reverse proxy that performs authentication,
    which sets the authenticated user name as an HTTP header and pass it on to Jenkins.

    <p>
    According to <a href="http://www.ruby-forum.com/topic/83067">this thread</a> and
    <a href="http://old.nabble.com/Forcing-a-proxied-host-to-generate-REMOTE_USER-td2911573.html#a2914465">this thread</a>,
    Apache configuration to do this would something like this:

<pre>
# prevent the client from setting these headers
RequestHeader unset X-Forwarded-User
RequestHeader unset X-Forwarded-Groups

RewriteEngine On
# see the Apache documentation on why this has to be lookahead
RewriteCond %{LA-U:REMOTE_USER} (.+)
# this actually doesn't rewrite anything. what we do here is to set RU to the match above
RewriteRule .* - [E=RU:%1]
RequestHeader set X-Forwarded-User %{RU}e
</pre>
